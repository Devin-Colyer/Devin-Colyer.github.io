        <h1>I'm Dev Colyer. Game Programmer.</h1>
        <p>'Sup! I'm Dev Colyer, a hardworking, entry-level, game programmer, looking for industry work as a gameplay programmer.
            I'm inspired by many games and other media to create interesting, fun, and accessible experiences which give players lasting memories.
            Some of the works that really inspire me are classics like Dark Souls, Halo, and Devil May Cry.
            While others are indie games like Blasphemous, Slay the Spire, and Coffee Talk.
            I strive to ensure my code is efficient, well-structured, and thoroughly documented.</p>
